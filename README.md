## Installation

    npm install pg

## Example

    var pg = require('pg');
    var connectionString = "pg://user:password@host:port/database";
    pg.connect(connectionString, function(err, client) {
      if(err) {
        //handle connection error
      }
      else {
        //queries are queued and executed in order
        client.query("CREATE TEMP TABLE user(name varchar(50), birthday timestamptz)");
        client.query("INSERT INTO user(name, birthday) VALUES('brianc', '1982-01-01T10:21:11')");
        
        //parameterized queries with transparent type coercion
        client.query("INSERT INTO user(name, birthday) VALUES($1, $2)", ['santa', new Date()]);
        
        //nested queries with callbacks
        client.query("SELECT * FROM user ORDER BY name", function(err, result) {
          if(err) {
            //handle query error
          }
          else {
            client.query("SELECT birthday FROM user WHERE name = $1", [result.rows[0].name], function(err, result) {
              //typed parameters and results
              assert.ok(result.rows[0].birthday.getYear() === 1982)
            })
          }
        })
      }
    }
