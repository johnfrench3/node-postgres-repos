# node-pg-pool
A connection pool for node-postgres

## install
```sh
npm i pg-pool pg
```

## use

to use pg-pool you must first create an instance of a pool

```js
//by default the pool uses the same
//configuration as whatever `pg` version you have installed
const pool = new Pool()

//you can pass properties to the pool
//these properties are passed unchanged to both the node-postgres Client constructor
//and the node-pool (https://github.com/coopernurse/node-pool) constructor
//allowing you to fully configure the behavior of both
const pool2 = new Pool({
  database: 'postgres',
  user: 'brianc',
  password: 'secret!',
  port: 5432,
  ssl: true,
  max: 20, //set pool max size to 20
  min: 4, //set min pool size to 4
  idleTimeoutMillis: 1000 //close idle clients after 1 second
})

//you can supply a custom client constructor
//if you want to use the native postgres client
const NativeClient = require('pg').native.Client
const nativePool = new Pool({ Client: NativeClient })

//you can even pool pg-native clients directly
const PgNativeClient = require('pg-native')
const pgNativePool = new Pool({ Client: PgNativeClient })
```

pg-pool supports a fully promise-based api for acquiring clients

```js
const pool = new Pool()
pool.connect().then(client => {
  client.query('select $1::text as name', ['pg-pool']).then(res => {
    client.release()
    console.log('hello from', res.rows[0].name)
  })
  .catch(e => {
    client.release()
    console.error('query error', e.message, e.stack)
  })
})
```

pg-pool supports the traditional callback api for acquiring a client that node-postgres has shipped with internally for years:

```js
const pool = new Pool()
pool.connect((err, client, done) => {
  if (err) return done(err)
  
  client.query('SELECT $1::text as name', ['pg-pool'], (err, res) => {
    done()
    if (err) {
      return console.error('query error', e.message, e.stack)
    }
    console.log('hello from', res.rows[0].name)
  })
})
```

When you are finished with the pool if all the clients are idle the pool will close them after `config.idleTimeoutMillis` and your app
will shutdown gracefully.  If you don't want to wait for the timeout you can end the pool as follows:

```js
const pool = new Pool()
const client = await pool.connect()
console.log(await client.query('select now()'))
client.release()
await pool.end()
```
