# pg-pool
A connection pool for node-postgres

## install
```sh
npm i pg-pool pg
```

## use

to use pg-pool you must first create an instance of a pool

```js
//by default the pool uses the same
//configuration as whatever `pg` version you have installed
const pool = new Pool()

//you can pass properties to the pool
//these properties are passed unchanged to both the node-postgres Client constructor
//and the node-pool (https://github.com/coopernurse/node-pool) constructor
//allowing you to fully configure the behavior of both
const pool2 = new Pool({
  database: 'postgres',
  user: 'brianc',
  password: 'secret!',
  port: 5432,
  ssl: true,
  max: 20, //set pool max size to 20
  min: 4, //set min pool size to 4
  idleTimeoutMillis: 1000 //close idle clients after 1 second
})

//you can supply a custom client constructor
//if you want to use the native postgres client
const NativeClient = require('pg').native.Client
const nativePool = new Pool({ Client: NativeClient })

//you can even pool pg-native clients directly
const PgNativeClient = require('pg-native')
const pgNativePool = new Pool({ Client: PgNativeClient })
```

pg-pool supports a fully promise-based api for acquiring clients

```js
const pool = new Pool()
pool.connect().then(client => {
  client.query('select $1::text as name', ['pg-pool']).then(res => {
    client.release()
    console.log('hello from', res.rows[0].name)
  })
  .catch(e => {
    client.release()
    console.error('query error', e.message, e.stack)
  })
})
```

this ends up looking much nicer if you're using [co](https://github.com/tj/co) or async/await:

```js
const pool = new Pool()
const client = await pool.connect()
try {
  const result = await client.query('select $1::text as name', ['brianc'])
  console.log('hello from', result.rows[0])
} finally {
  client.release()
}
```

because its so common to just run a query and return the client to the pool afterward pg-pool has this built-in:

```js
const pool = new Pool()
const time = await pool.query('SELECT NOW()')
const name = await pool.query('select $1::text as name', ['brianc'])
console.log(name.rows[0].name, 'says hello at', time.rows[0].name)
```
__pro tip:__ unless you need to run a transaction (which requires a single client for multiple queries) or you
have some other edge case like [streaming rows](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-query-stream) or using a [cursor](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-cursor)
you should almost always just use `pool.query`.  Its easy, it does the right thing :tm:, and wont ever forget to return
clients back to the pool after the query is done.

pg-pool still and will always support the traditional callback api for acquiring a client that node-postgres has shipped with internally for years:

```js
const pool = new Pool()
pool.connect((err, client, done) => {
  if (err) return done(err)

  client.query('SELECT $1::text as name', ['pg-pool'], (err, res) => {
    done()
    if (err) {
      return console.error('query error', e.message, e.stack)
    }
    console.log('hello from', res.rows[0].name)
  })
})
```

That means you can drop pg-pool into your app and 99% of the cases you wont even notice a difference.  In fact, very soon I will be using pg-pool internally within node-postgres itself!

When you are finished with the pool if all the clients are idle the pool will close them after `config.idleTimeoutMillis` and your app
will shutdown gracefully.  If you don't want to wait for the timeout you can end the pool as follows:

```js
const pool = new Pool()
const client = await pool.connect()
console.log(await client.query('select now()'))
client.release()
await pool.end()
```

## tests

To run tests clone the repo, `npm i` in the working dir, and then run `npm test`
