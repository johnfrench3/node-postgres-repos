# pg-pool
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brianc/node-pg-pool.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brianc/node-pg-pool)

A connection pool for node-postgres

## install
```sh
npm i pg-pool pg
```

## use

### create

to use pg-pool you must first create an instance of a pool

```js
const Pool = require('pg-pool')

//by default the pool uses the same
//configuration as whatever `pg` version you have installed
const pool = new Pool()

//you can pass properties to the pool
//these properties are passed unchanged to both the node-postgres Client constructor
//and the node-pool (https://github.com/coopernurse/node-pool) constructor
//allowing you to fully configure the behavior of both
const pool2 = new Pool({
  database: 'postgres',
  user: 'brianc',
  password: 'secret!',
  port: 5432,
  ssl: true,
  max: 20, //set pool max size to 20
  min: 4, //set min pool size to 4
  idleTimeoutMillis: 1000 //close idle clients after 1 second
})

//you can supply a custom client constructor
//if you want to use the native postgres client
const NativeClient = require('pg').native.Client
const nativePool = new Pool({ Client: NativeClient })

//you can even pool pg-native clients directly
const PgNativeClient = require('pg-native')
const pgNativePool = new Pool({ Client: PgNativeClient })
```

### acquire clients with a promise

pg-pool supports a fully promise-based api for acquiring clients

```js
const pool = new Pool()
pool.connect().then(client => {
  client.query('select $1::text as name', ['pg-pool']).then(res => {
    client.release()
    console.log('hello from', res.rows[0].name)
  })
  .catch(e => {
    client.release()
    console.error('query error', e.message, e.stack)
  })
})
```

### plays nice with async/await

this ends up looking much nicer if you're using [co](https://github.com/tj/co) or async/await:

```js
const pool = new Pool()
const client = await pool.connect()
try {
  const result = await client.query('select $1::text as name', ['brianc'])
  console.log('hello from', result.rows[0])
} finally {
  client.release()
}
```

### your new favorite helper method

because its so common to just run a query and return the client to the pool afterward pg-pool has this built-in:

```js
const pool = new Pool()
const time = await pool.query('SELECT NOW()')
const name = await pool.query('select $1::text as name', ['brianc'])
console.log(name.rows[0].name, 'says hello at', time.rows[0].name)
```
__pro tip:__ unless you need to run a transaction (which requires a single client for multiple queries) or you
have some other edge case like [streaming rows](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-query-stream) or using a [cursor](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-cursor)
you should almost always just use `pool.query`.  Its easy, it does the right thing :tm:, and wont ever forget to return
clients back to the pool after the query is done.

### drop-in backwards compatible

pg-pool still and will always support the traditional callback api for acquiring a client.  This is the exact API node-postgres has shipped with internally for years:

```js
const pool = new Pool()
pool.connect((err, client, done) => {
  if (err) return done(err)

  client.query('SELECT $1::text as name', ['pg-pool'], (err, res) => {
    done()
    if (err) {
      return console.error('query error', e.message, e.stack)
    }
    console.log('hello from', res.rows[0].name)
  })
})
```

That means you can drop pg-pool into your app and 99% of the cases you wont even notice a difference.  In fact, very soon I will be using pg-pool internally within node-postgres itself!

### shut it down

When you are finished with the pool if all the clients are idle the pool will close them after `config.idleTimeoutMillis` and your app
will shutdown gracefully.  If you don't want to wait for the timeout you can end the pool as follows:

```js
const pool = new Pool()
const client = await pool.connect()
console.log(await client.query('select now()'))
client.release()
await pool.end()
```

### events

Every instance of a `Pool` is an event emitter.  These instances emit the following events:

#### error

Emitted whenever an idle client in the pool encounters an error.  This is common when your PostgreSQL server shuts down, reboots, or a network partition otherwise causes it to become unavailable while your pool has connected clients.

Example:

```js
var pg = require('pg')
var pool = new pg.Pool()

// attach an error handler to the pool for when a connected, idle client 
// receives an error by being disconnected, etc
pool.on('error', function(error, client) {
  // handle this in the same way you would treat process.on('uncaughtException')
  // it is supplied the error as well as the idle client which received the error
})
```

#### connect

Fired whenever the pool creates a __new__ `pg.Client` instance and successfully connects it to the backend.

Example:

```js
var pg = require('pg')
var pool = new pg.Pool()

var count = 0

pool.on('connect', client => {
  client.count = count++
})

pool.connect()
  .then(client => {
    client.query('SELECT $1::int AS "clientCount', [client.count])
      .then(res => console.log(res.rows[0].clientCount)) // outputs 0
  }))

```

This allows you to do custom bootstrapping and manipulation of clients after they have been successfully connected to the PostgreSQL backend, but before any queries have been issued.

### environment variables

pg-pool & node-postgres support some of the same environment variables as `psql` supports.  The most common are:

```
PGDATABASE=my_db
PGUSER=username
PGPASSWORD="my awesome password"
PGPORT=5432
PGSSLMODE=require
```

Usually I will export these into my local environment via a `.env` file with environment settings or export them in `~/.bash_profile` or something similar.  This way I get configurability which works with both the postgres suite of tools (`psql`, `pg_dump`, `pg_restore`) and node, I can vary the environment variables locally and in production, and it supports the concept of a [12-factor app](http://12factor.net/) out of the box.

## tests

To run tests clone the repo, `npm i` in the working dir, and then run `npm test`
